Find the current stable released executables and archived source files here. In most cases you will probably want the 64 Bit version (*X64*), but there is a X86 - 32 Bit version if you like. For Linux there is the Linux executable and Debian installer&#46; There is a MacOS build&#44; but it is not guaranteed to work 100&#37;&#46; If anyone wants to fork or submit to the MacOs version then please be my guest&#46;

For any version of the binary you&#39;ll probably want to change the name of the executable to just&#58; *`colorstatic`*&#46;
